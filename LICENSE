Licensing of XZ Utils test files (quoting from testdata/xz-utils/README)
========================================================================

    This directory contains bunch of files to test handling of .xz
    files in .xz decoder implementations. Many of the files have been
    created by hand with a hex editor, thus there is no better "source
    code" than the files themselves. All the test files (*.xz) and
    this README have been put into the public domain.
